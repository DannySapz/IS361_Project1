# IS362_Project1
First Project of the course


(1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information below. You may change the structure of the information as you like.
(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into pandas, and perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.
(3) Your code should be in a Jupyter (IPython) notebook (in GitHub), and should include narrative descriptions of your analysis and conclusions.

all the conclusions and analysis are in the comments of the jupyter notebook file.

P.S. sorry for the mess, i was experimenting with a lot of things, trying to find the best way to present the information.
